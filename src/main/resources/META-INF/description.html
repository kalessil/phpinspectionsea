This plugin is an open-source Code Review and Static Code Analysis tool for PHP (aka inspections in JetBrains IDEs).<br />
<br />
It covers:<br />
- architecture related issues<br />
- weak types control and possible code construct simplifications<br />
- performance issues<br />
- non-optimal, duplicate and suspicious "if" conditions<br />
- validation of magic methods usage<br />
- regular expressions<br />
- compatibility issues<br />
- variety of time-consuming bugs<br />
- PHPUnit API usage<br />
- security issues<br />
<br />
Some inspections are expecting conditional statements (e.g. "if") to use group statement for wrapping body expressions. If this requirement is met then additional inspections are applied to the source code.<br />
<br />
For Mac shortcuts, see <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/help/keyboard-shortcuts-and-mouse-reference.html">this reference card</a>. Windows/Linux ones are:<br />
<b>Alt + Shift + I</b> to <b>inspect current file</b> with current profile<br />
<b>Ctrl + Alt + Shift + I</b> to <b>run inspection by name</b><br />
<b>Ctrl + Shift + F4</b> to <b>close results</b> of inspection.<br />
<br />
On some projects CPU and therefore battery usage could be intensive, so it should be taken into account when traveling with a laptop.<br />
