Analyzes continue usage in switch-case context. Due to PHP's
<a href="https://secure.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.continue.php">unusual continue syntax</a>,
new users who are used to other languages might be confused by its behaviour.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Covers following case:
</p>

<code lang="php">
    for (...) {
        switch(...) {
            case ...:
                continue; /* should read 'continue 2' to continue with the next iteration of the outer loop */
            ...
        }
    }
</code>

<p>
This is PHP-specific and mentioned in <a href="https://secure.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.continue.php">documentation</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
    Note: In PHP the switch statement is considered a looping structure for the purposes of continue. continue behaves
    like break (when no arguments are passed). If a switch is inside a loop, continue 2 will continue with the next
    iteration of the outer loop.
